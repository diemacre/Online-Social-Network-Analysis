CS 579 Assignment 4

In this assignment, we use TwitterAPI to collect twitter users and tweets for clustering and sentiment analysis. There are four python scripts, collect.py, cluster.py, classify.py and summarize.py. 

-> collect.py: is to collect twitter user information and tweets. I chosed 6 initial users and their friends as users for community detection. The 6 initial users are related to politics, football and writing. They are all famous. The initial users are Donnal Trump, The white house, Wayne Rooney, Kane, JK rowlling and Stephen King. I collected their user id, screen name and the list of their friends. For sentiment analysis, I collect 100 most recent tweets that mention @realDonaltrump to classify them into positive, negative or neutral tweets.

-> cluster.py: is to divide the initial 6 users and their friends into different communities. Since the total number of users is too large, we only include users that are followed by at least 5 of the initial users. During the clustering process, I use Girvan_Newman algorithm with betweenness of each edge.

-> classify.py: we used a dataset from twitter already labeles with positive, negative and neutral clases to train and test the model. An accuracy of 88.65% is obtained. Then we collect the tweets from twitter where Donnal Trump is names. And we use the trained model to predict the label of these collected tweets.

-> summarize.py: writes the output into summary.txt.

Conclusions:

For clustering: 

As we can see from the clusters_net, there are 3 clusters. 

-Cluster 1: realDonaldTrump -> politics
-Cluster 2: WayneRooney and HKane -> football
-Cluster 3: jk_rowling , Stephenking and Whitehouse. -> writers

These seem right as the chosen users where of 3 types: politics, football and writing. It is curious that the White House was clustered with the writers instead of with Donald Trump. This is because the White House has more friends in common with these famous writers. 


For sentiment analysis:

In can be seen that the classification into the different labels from the collected tweets that name Donnal Trump most of the classified tweets are neutral. There are just a few negative and the rest are possitive. This make sense as Donal trump is the president and people tend to repect him on social media and also there are many people that do not want to show their idiology so the tweets they are more neutral. However, sometimes it does not classify them well. This is because of the source where we got the tweets for trining the model that they could be diferent type than the ones collected. To have a better aproach a dataset of tweets that involves politics could be used to train the model instead of the ones used (it works the same way).
